# RemoteFileStreamer

RemoteFileStreamer is a micro-library to stream a remote file.
Mostly, it provides a `stream` function taking a url as an input and returns a stream out of it.
If the server hosting the resource allows it, a file a streamed from a url

## Installation

The package is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/remote_file_streamer), and can be installed
by adding `file_streamer` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:remote_file_streamer, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Examples

The following example will stream the content from the file located in the url, and consume the stream by outputing every chunks composing the resource:

```
  url
  |> RemoteFileStream.stream
  |> Enum.each(fn(chunk) -> IO.puts chunk end)
```
